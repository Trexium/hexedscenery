        //                         well-known fact that the stones are rich in
        //                         magic, and they are said to grant a variety of
        //                         powers to those that learn to use them. Tales
        //                         are told among the common folk of stones
        //                         that caused a certain farmer’s harvest to
        //                         double, or of the stone that made old Herr
        //                         Grutenbauer's dog speak like a man. True or
        //                         not, these tales hint at the powerful and
        //                         chaotic forces at work in the stones. The most
        //                         common use for the stones’ magic has to do
        //                         with the discovery of the famed alchemist van
        //                         Hoffman of Reikland. It was he who first
        //                         observed that Wyrdstone can serve as a
        //                         catalyst in the transmutation of base metals
        //                         into gold. This usage of the stones has come
        //                         to be the primary obsession of those who seek
        //                         it, for many are willing to pay princely sums
        //                         for stones that will make them an even larger
        //                         fortune. Yet there are those who continue to
        //                         seek the stones for their more arcane
        //                         uses, and even mercenaries have
        //                         been known to keep a stone
        //                         or two that was thought
        //                         to bring luck, healing,
        //                         or other magical
        //                         benefits.<br /><br />
        //                         Yet the stones
        //                         are ultimately
        //                         the work of
        //                         Chaos, and
        //                         those who
        //                         seek to

        //                         often

        //                         fear their magic rather than harness it. For
        //                         every tale of a harvest that doubled, there are
        //                         two about the harvests that rotted in the field
        //                         when exposed to the strange glow of the
        //                         stones; and for every tale of a dog that learned
        //                         to speak like a man there are darker tales of
        //                         animals that turned into a gruesome parody of
        //                         a man-beast. The tales of magical healings are
        //                         mixed with many of mutation and death
        //                         brought on by exposure to the stones. Yet
        //                         greed is the downfall of many in the City of
        //                         the Damned, and the greed for power is
        //                         perhaps the greatest of all...<br /><br />

        //                         Bretonnians, High Elf Shadow Warriors and
        //                         Dwarfs are all too aware of the corrupting
        //                         power of the stones, and will not make use of
        //                         them under any circumstances.<br /><br />

        //                         an alchemist for useful magical properties.

        //                         battle). Instead of searching for a rare item, a

        //                         services for free; for each stone evaluated, the
        //                         warband must pay 20 gold crowns. When the
