    <p>Welcome to my Mordheim-helper site. Here you will be able to find helpfull tools to play a game of Mordheim with less distractions and pdf-scrolling.</p>
    <p>For now the only availble tool is the <a href="mordheim/randomhappenings">Random Happenings lookup.</a></p>
    <p>I'm currently working on something to help filtering through all the varius Hired Swords available to each warband. I am however open for suggestions, so if you'd like some tool to help with anything thats dragging your games down just hit me up on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hexedscenery/">HexedScenery</a>.</p>
